# NerveStitcher: Corneal Confocal Microscope Images Stitching with Neural Networks

## Introduction

NerveStitcher is a deep learning based corneal confocal microscopic image stitching tool. The tool integrates the functions of microscope vignetting correction and image stitching, and can process corneal nerve images in a pipeline. Input sequential images (without pre-defined acquisition sequences) and output vignetting corrected images and stitching results. 

It has extremely high efficiency and accuracy, in our preliminary experiments: NVIDIA GeForce GTX1060 6G stitching time is about 0.331 seconds (per image pair) under GPU hardware acceleration. i5-4460 3.2GHz stitching time is about 0.945 seconds (per image pair) under CPU hardware acceleration.

NerveStitcher was developed by *Tianyu Li* of TGU-UOW Lab on the basis of [SuperGlue](https://github.com/magicleap/SuperGluePretrainedNetwork).
